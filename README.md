This is a landing page project, using more flex box and css in this one, maybe adding javascript to it later.

I decided to make it about midi keyboards! Thought it'd be fun lol. Created the main page, I may add a sign up page to it later.

You can view the page here: (It is not optimized for mobiles yet, so...)
